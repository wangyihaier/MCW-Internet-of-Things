# Internet of Things hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives

This workshop is designed to guide you through an implementation of an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. In this session, you will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path. After completing the package, you will be better able to implement device registration with the IoT Hub registry and visualize hot data with Power BI.

Learning objectives:

-   Implement a simulator sending telemetry from smart meters

-   Capture and process both hot and cold data using Stream Analytics and HDInsight with Spark

-   Visualize hot data with Power BI

## Overview

Fabrikam provides services and smart meters for enterprise energy (electrical power) management. Their "*You-Left-The-Light-On*" service enables the enterprise to understand their energy consumption.

In this hands-on lab, you will construct an end-to-end solution for an IoT scenario that includes device management; telemetry ingest; hot and cold path processing; and reporting.

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    -   Trial subscriptions will *not* work.

2.  A virtual machine configured with:

    -   Visual Studio Community 2017 or later

    -   Azure SDK 2.9 or later (Included with Visual Studio 2017)

3.  A running HDInsight Spark cluster (see [Before the Hands-on Lab](#_Before_the_Hands-on)).


## Exercise 1: Environment setup

Duration: 10 minutes

Fabrikam has provided a Smart Meter Simulator that they use to simulate device registration, as well as the generation and transmission of telemetry data. They have asked you to use this as the starting point for integrating their smart meters with Azure.

### Task 1: Download and open the Smart Meter Simulator project

1.  Connect to your Lab VM, as was detailed in Before the Hands-on Lab, Task 4.

2.  From your Lab VM, download the Smart Meter Simulator starter project from the following URL: <https://bit.ly/2wMSwsH> (Note: the URL is case-sensitive)

3.  Unzip the contents to the folder C:\\SmartMeter\\.

4.  Open SmartMeterSimulator.sln with Visual Studio 2017.

5.  Sign in to Visual Studio or create an account, if prompted.

6.  If the Security Warning for SmartMeterSimulator window appears, uncheck *Ask me for every project in this solution*, and select **OK**.
    
    ![The SmartMeterSimulator Security Warning window has the option to \"Ask me for every project in this solution\" circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image28.png "SmartMeterSimulator Security Warning")

**Note:** If you attempt to build the solution at this point, you will see many build errors. This is intentional. You will correct these in the exercises that follow.

## Exercise 2: IoT Hub provisioning

Duration: 20 minutes

In your architecture design session with Fabrikam, it was agreed that you would use an Azure IoT Hub to manage both the device registration and telemetry ingest from the Smart Meter Simulator. Your team also identified the Microsoft provided Device Explorer project that Fabrikam can use to view the list and status of devices in the IoT Hub registry.

### Task 1: Provision an IoT Hub

In these steps, you will provision an instance of IoT Hub.

1.  In a browser, navigate to the Azure Portal (<https://portal.azure.com)>.

2.  Select **+New**, then select **Internet of Things**, and select **IoT Hub**.
    
    ![In the Azure Portal, new is selected in the left pane. In the right, New pane, under Azure Marketplace, Internet of Things is selected, and under Featured, IoT Hub is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image29.png "Azure Portal, New pane")

3.  In the **IoT Hub** blade, enter the following:

    -   Name: Provide a name for your new IoT Hub, such as smartmeter-hub

    -   Pricing and scale tier: Select **F1** **Free**

    -   IoT Hub units: Set to **1** automatically when the F1 pricing tier is selected.

    -   Device-to-cloud partitions: Set to **2 partitions** automatically when the F1 pricing tier is selected.

    -   Subscription: Select the same subscription you've been using for previous resources in this lab.

    -   Resource group: Select Use existing, and select the **iot-hol** resource group you created previously.

    -   Location: Select the location you used previously.

        ![The IoT hub blade fields display with the previously mentioned settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image30.png "IoT hub blade")

    -   Select **Create**.

4.  When the IoT Hub deployment is completed, you will receive a notification in the Azure portal. Navigate to your new IoT Hub by selecting Go to resource in the notification.

    ![In the Notifications section, under Deployment succeeded, the Go to resource button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image31.png "Notifications section")

5.  From the IoT Hub's Overview blade, select **Shared access policies** under Settings on the left-hand menu.
    
    ![In the Overview blade settings section, Shared access policies is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image32.png "Overview blade, settings section")

6.  Select **iothubowner** policy.
    
    ![Under Policy, iothubowner is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image33.png "Policy section")

7.  In the iothubowner blade, select the **Copy** button to the right of the **Connection string - primary key** field. You will be pasting the connection string value into a TextBox's Text property value in the next Task.
    
    ![The iothubowner blade fields display with the previously mentioned settings. Under Shared access keys, the Connection string???primary key and its corresponding copy button are circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image34.png "iothubowner blade")

### Task 2: Configure the Smart Meter Simulator

If you want to save this connection string with your project (in case you stop debugging or otherwise close the simulator), you can set this as the default text for the text box. Follow these steps to configure the connection string:

1.  Return to Visual Studio on your Lab VM.

2.  In the Solution Explorer, double-click **MainForm.cs** to open it. (If the Solution Explorer is not in the upper left corner of your Visual Studio instance, you can find it under the View menu in Visual Studio.)

    ![In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, SmartMeterSimulator is expanded, and under it, MainForm.cs is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image35.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

3.  In the Windows Forms designer surface, click the **IoT Hub Connection String TextBox** to select it.
    
    ![The Windows Form designer surface is opened to the MainForm.cs tab. The IoT Hub Connection String is circled, but is empty.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image36.png "Windows Form designer surface")

4.  In the Properties panel, scroll until you see the **Text** property. Paste your IoT Hub connection string value copied in step 7 of the previous task into the value for the Text property. (If the properties window is not visible below the Solution Explorer, right-click the TextBox, and select **Properties**.)\
    
    ![In the Properties panel, the Text property is circled, and is set to HostName=smartmeter-hub.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image37.png "Solution Explorer")

5.  Your connection string should now be present every time you run the Smart Meter Simulator.
    
    ![The Windows Form designer surface is opened to the MainForm.cs tab. The IoT Hub Connection String now displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image38.png "IoT Hub Connection String dialog")

## Exercise 3: Completing the Smart Meter Simulator

Duration: 60 minutes

Fabrikam has left you a partially completed sample in the form of the Smart Meter Simulator solution. You will need to complete the missing lines of code that deal with device registration management and device telemetry transmission that communicate with your IoT Hub.

### Task 1: Implement device management with the IoT Hub

1.  In Visual Studio on your Lab VM, use Solution Explorer to open the file **DeviceManager.cs**.

2.  From the Visual Studio **View** menu, click **Task List**.

    ![On the Visual Studio View menu, Task List is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image39.png "Visual Studio View menu")

3.  There you will see a list of TODO tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed. Copy the code in **bold** below the corresponding TODO item in the completed code that follows.

4.  The following code represents the completed tasks in DeviceManager.cs:
    ```
    class DeviceManager
    {
        static string connectionString;
        static RegistryManager registryManager;

        public static string HostName { get; set; }

        public static void IotHubConnect(string cnString)
        {
            connectionString = cnString;

            //TODO: 1.Create an instance of RegistryManager from connectionString
            registryManager = RegistryManager.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);

            var builder = IotHubConnectionStringBuilder.Create(cnString);

            HostName = builder.HostName;
        }

    }
    ```
5.  Save DeviceManager.cs.

### Task 2: Implement the communication of telemetry with the IoT Hub

1.  Open Sensor.cs from the Solution Explorer, and complete the TODO items indicated within the code that are responsible for transmitting telemetry data to the IoT Hub.

2.  The following code shows the completed result:
    ```
    class Sensor
    {
        private DeviceClient _DeviceClient;
        private string _IotHubUri { get; set; }
        public string DeviceId { get; set; }
        public string DeviceKey { get; set; }
        public DeviceState State { get; set; }
        public string StatusWindow { get; set; }
        public double CurrentTemperature
        {
            get
            {
                double avgTemperature = 70;
                Random rand = new Random();
                 
                double currentTemperature = avgTemperature + rand.Next(-6, 6);

                if(currentTemperature <= 68)
                    TemperatureIndicator = SensorState.Cold;
                else if(currentTemperature > 68 && currentTemperature < 72)
                    TemperatureIndicator = SensorState.Normal;
                else if(currentTemperature >= 72)
                    TemperatureIndicator = SensorState.Hot;

                return currentTemperature;
            }
        }

        public SensorState TemperatureIndicator { get; set; }

        public Sensor(string iotHubUri, string deviceId, string deviceKey)
        {
            _IotHubUri = iotHubUri;
            DeviceId = deviceId;
            DeviceKey = deviceKey;
            State = DeviceState.Registered;

        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Connect a device to the IoT Hub by instantiating a DeviceClient for that Device by Id and Key.

            //TODO: 17. Connect the Device to Iot Hub by creating an instance of DeviceClient
            _DeviceClient = DeviceClient.Create(_IotHubUri, new DeviceAuthenticationWithRegistrySymmetricKey(DeviceId, DeviceKey));

            //Set the Device State to Ready
            State = DeviceState.Ready;
        }

        public void DisconnectDevice()
        {

5.  In the first text area (referred to as a paragraph in notebook jargon), enter the following **Scala code** that will load, parse, and save your batch scored telemetry data as a table that you can later query using Spark SQL. Before executing, make sure to replace the highlighted text with the correct path to your telemetry file, noted previously in the Cloud Explorer in Visual Studio.
    ```
    import spark.implicits._

    val rawText = spark.read.text("wasb:///smartmeters/2017/08/20/19/1008078303_90a84f7aba614d1fa4688cbda1de3846_1.csv")
    case class SmartMeterMetrics(id:String,time:String,temp:Integer)
    val telemetryRDD = rawText.map(row => row.getString(0).split(",")).filter(s=>s(0) != "id").map(
        s => SmartMeterMetrics(s(0), s(1), s(2).toInt)
    )
    val telemetryDF = telemetryRDD.toDF()
    telemetryDF.write.saveAsTable("SmartMeters")

8.  In the second cell, enter the following SQL query and run it.
    ```
    %%sql
    select id, count(*) as count, avg(temp) averageTemp from SmartMeters group by id order by id
    ```

    You will see a table like the following:

    ![A table with three columns displays: id, count, and average temp. Devices 0 through 6 have counts varying between 59 and 60, and average Temps between 69.0 and 69.9.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image97.png "Table")

9.  Next, create a table that will summarize the telemetry collected using the previous query. In a new paragraph, try running the following query:
    ```
    //query the table to create a summary result set
    val summary = spark.sql("select id, count(*) as count, avg(temp) averageTemp from SmartMeters group by id order by id")

    //save the new pre-computed view
    summary.write.saveAsTable("DeviceSummary")

## Exercise 6: Reporting device outages with IoT Hub Operations Monitoring

Duration: 20 minutes

Fabrikam would like to be alerted when devices disconnect and fail to reconnect after a period. Since they are already using PowerBI to visualize hot data, they would like to see a list of any of these devices in a report.

### Task 1: Enable verbose connection monitoring on the IoT Hub

To keep track of device connects and disconnects, we first need to enable verbose connection monitoring.

1.  In your browser, navigate to the **Azure Portal** (<https://portal.azure.com)>.

2.  Open the IoT Hub you provisioned earlier, **smart-meter**.

3.  Under SETTINGS in the left-hand menu, click on **Operations monitoring**.
    
    ![Under Settings, Operations monitoring is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image99.png "Settings section")

4.  Select **Verbose** for **Log events when a device connects or disconnects from the IoT Hub**.

    ![In the Monitoring categories section, Verbose is selected under Log events when a device connects or disconnects from the IoT Hub.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image100.png "Monitoring categories section")

5.  Click **Save**.

### Task 2: Collect device connection telemetry with the hot path Stream Analytics job

Now that the device connections are being logged, update your hot path Stream Analytics job (the first one you created) with a new input that ingests device telemetry from Operations Monitoring. Next, create a query that joins all connected and disconnected events with a DATEDIFF function that only returns devices with a disconnect event, but no reconnect event within 120 seconds. Output the events to Power BI.

1.  In your browser, navigate to the **Azure Portal** (<https://portal.azure.com)>.

2.  Open the **hot-stream** Stream Analytics job (the first one you created).

3.  Stop the job if it is currently running, from the Overview blade, by selecting **Stop**, then **Yes** when prompted.
    
    ![The Stop button is circled on the Overview blade top menu.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image101.png "Overview blade Stop button")

4.  Select **Inputs** on the left-hand menu, under Job Topology.

    ![Under Job Topology, Inputs is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image49.png "Job Topology Section")

5.  On the Inputs blade, select **+Add**, then **IoT Hub** to add an input connected to your IoT Hub.
    
    ![Add new IoT Hub stream input to Stream Analytics](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image50.png "Job topolog add stream input hub")

6.  On the New Input blade, enter the following:

    -   Input Alias: Set the value to **connections**.

    -   Import Option: Choose **Select IoT hub from your subscriptions**.

    -   IoT Hub: Select your existing IoT Hub, **smartmeter-hub**.

    -   Endpoint: Choose **Operations monitoring**.

    -   Shared Access Policy Name: Set to **Service**.

    -   Consumer Group: Leave as **\$Default**.

    -   Event serialization format: Choose **JSON**.

    -   Encoding: Choose **UTF-8**.

    -   Event compression type: Leave set to **None**.

        ![Create new IoT Hub input form for Stream Analytics](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image102.png "IoT hub new input blade")

    -   Select **Save**.

7. Now, select **Outputs** from the left-hand menu, under Job Topology.

    ![Under Job Topology, Outputs is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image52.png "Job Topology Section")

8. In the Outputs blade, select **+Add**, the **Power BI**, to add the output destination for the query.
    
    ![Select +Add, then Power BI within the outputs blade of your Stream Analytics instance](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image53.png "Outputs blade add Power BI")

9. On the New output blade, enter the following:

    -   Set the **Output alias** to **powerbi-outage**.

        ![Enter powerbi-outage for the output alias, then select Authorize to authenticate to your Power BI subscription](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image103.png "Poewr BI new output")

    -   Select **Authorize** under Authorize Connection.

    Follow the on-screen prompts to log on to your Power BI account.

    After authenticating, complete the remaining fields as follows:

    -   Group Workspace: Leave set to **My Workspace**.

    -   Dataset Name: Enter **deviceoutage**

    -   Table Name: Enter **deviceoutage**

    -   Select **Save**.

        ![Complete the form by entering deviceoutage as both the Dataset name and Table name. Select the My workspace Group workspace option](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image104.png "Power BI new input ")

10. Next, select **Query** from the left-hand menu, under Job Topology.
    
    ![Under Job Topology, Query is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image56.png "Job Topology Section")

11. We will replace the hot path query, which selects the averages of the temperatures into the PowerBI output, with queries that perform the following:

    -   Select **device disconnection events**.

    -   Select **device connection events**.

    -   Join these two streams together using the Stream Analytics DATEDIFF operation on the LEFT JOIN, and then filter out any records where there was a match. This gives us devices that had a disconnect event, but no corresponding connect event within 120 seconds. Output to the Service Bus.

    -   Execute the original hot path query.

12. Replace the existing query with the following, and click **Save** in the **command bar** at the top. (Be sure to substitute in your output aliases and input aliases):
    ```
    WITH
    Disconnected AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM connections TIMESTAMP BY [Time]
    WHERE OperationName = 'deviceDisconnect'
        AND Category = 'Connections'
    ),
    Connected AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM connections TIMESTAMP BY [Time]
    WHERE OperationName = 'deviceConnect'
        AND Category = 'Connections'
    )

    SELECT Disconnected.DeviceId, Disconnected.Time
    INTO [powerbi-outage] 
    FROM Disconnected
    LEFT JOIN Connected 
        ON DATEDIFF(second, Disconnected, Connected) BETWEEN 0 AND 120
        AND Connected.deviceId = Disconnected.deviceId
    WHERE Connected.DeviceId IS NULL;

    SELECT AVG(temp) AS Average, id
    INTO powerbi
    FROM temps
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 5), id;
    ```

13. Select **Save,** and **Yes** when prompted with the confirmation.

    ![Save button](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image57.png "Save button")

14. Return to the Overview blade on your Stream Analytics job, and select **Start**.

    ![The start button on the Overview blade is circled](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image58.png "Overview blade start button")

15. In the Start job blade, select **Now** (the job will start processing messages from the current point in time onward).
    
    ![Next to Job output start time, the Now button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image59.png "Now button")

16. Select **Start**.

17. Allow your Stream Analytics Job a few minutes to start.

### Task 3: Test the device outage notifications

Register and activate a few devices on the Smart Meter Simulator, then connect them. Deactivate them without reconnecting in order for them to show up in the device outage report we will create in the next task.

1.  Run the Smart Meter Simulator from Visual Studio.

2.  Click the **Register** button.
    
    ![Register button](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image105.png "Register button")

    ![Unregister button](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image110.png "Unregister button")

### Task 4: Visualize disconnected devices with Power BI

1.  Log on to **Power BI** to see if data is being collected.

2.  As done previously, select My Workspace on the left-hand menu, then select the Datasets tab. A new dataset should appear, named **deviceoutage**. (It is starred to indicate it is new) If you do not see the dataset, you may need to connect your devices on the Smart Meter Simulator, then disconnect and unregister them and wait up to 5 minutes.
    
    ![On the Power BI window, My Workspace is circled in the left pane, and the Datasets tab is circled in the right pane. Under Name, deviceoutage is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image111.png "Power BI window")

3.  Select the **Create report** icon under actions for the dataset.
    
    ![Next to deviceoutage, the Create report icon is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image112.png "Create report icon")

4.  Add a **Table visualization**.

    ![The table icon is circled on the Visualizations palette.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image113.png "Visualizations palette")

5.  Select the **deviceid** and **time** fields, which will automatically be added to the table. You should see the Device Id of each of the devices you connected, and then disconnected for more than 2 minutes.
    
    ![In the Fields listing, under deviceoutage, deviceid and time are both selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image114.png "Fields listing")\
    
    ![DeviceId and Time results display for Device one, Device five, and Device 8.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-InternetofThingsimages/media/image115.png "DeviceId and Time results")

6.  Save the report as **Disconnected Devices**.
