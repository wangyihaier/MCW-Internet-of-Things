# Internet of Things hands-on lab step-by-step

If you have not yet completed the steps to set up your environment in [Before the hands-on lab setup guide](./Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Internet%20of%20Things.md), you will need to do that before proceeding.

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will construct an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build an IoT solution implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.

## Overview

Fabrikam provides services and smart meters for enterprise energy (electrical power) management. Their "_You-Left-The-Light-On_" service enables the enterprise to understand their energy consumption.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![Diagram of the preferred solution. From a high-level, the commerce solution uses an API App to host the Payments web service with which the Vending Machine interacts to conduct purchase transactions. The Payment Web API invokes a 3rd party payment gateway as needed for authorizing and capturing credit card payments, and logs the purchase transaction to SQL DB. The data for these purchase transactions is stored using an In-Memory table with a Columnar Index, which will support the write-heavy workload while still allowing analytics to operate, such as queries coming from Power BI Desktop.](./media/preferred-solution-architecture.png 'Preferred high-level architecture')

Messages are ingested from the Smart Meters via IoT Hub and temporarily stored there. A Stream Analytics job pulls telemetry messages from IoT Hub and sends the messages to two different destinations. There are two Stream Analytics jobs, one that retrieves all messages and sends them to Blob Storage (the cold path), and another that selects out only the important events needed for reporting in real time (the hot path). Data entering the hot path will be reported on using Power BI visualizations and reports. For the cold path, Azure Databricks can be used to apply the batch computation needed for the reports at scale.

Other alternatives for processing of the ingested telemetry would be to use an HDInsight Storm cluster, a WebJob running the EventProcessorHost in place of Stream Analytics, or HDInsight running with Spark streaming. Depending on the type of message filtering being conducted for hot and cold stream separation, IoT Hub Message Routing might also be used, but this has the limitation that messages follow a single path, so with the current implementation, it would not be possible to send all messages to the cold path, while simultaneously sending some of the same messages into the hot path. An important limitation to keep in mind for Stream Analytics is that it is very restrictive on the format of the input data it can process: the payload must be UTF8 encoded JSON, UTF8 encoded CSV (fields delimited by commas, spaces, tabs, or vertical pipes), or AVRO, and it must be well formed. If any devices transmitting telemetry cannot generate output in these formats (e.g., because they are legacy devices), or their output can be not well formed at times, then alternatives that can better deal with these situations should be investigated. Additionally, any custom code or logic cannot be embedded with Stream Analytics---if greater extensibility is required, the alternatives should be considered.

>**Note**: The preferred solution is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
- A virtual machine configured with:
  - Visual Studio Community 2017 15.6 or later
  - Azure SDK 2.9 or later (Included with Visual Studio 2017)
- A running Azure Databricks cluster (see [Before the hands-on lab](#before-the-hands-on-lab))

## Exercise 1: IoT Hub provisioning

Duration: 15 minutes

In your architecture design session with Fabrikam, it was agreed that you would use an Azure IoT Hub to manage both the device registration and telemetry ingest from the Smart Meter Simulator. Your team also identified the Microsoft provided Device Explorer project that Fabrikam can use to view the list and status of devices in the IoT Hub registry.

### Task 1: Provision IoT Hub

In these steps, you will provision an instance of IoT Hub.

1. In your browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+Create a resource** in the navigation pane, enter "iot" into the Search the Marketplace box, select **IoT Hub** from the results, and select **Create**.

   ![+Create a resource is highlighted in the navigation page of the Azure portal, and "iot" is entered into the Search the Marketplace box. IoT Hub is highlighted in the search results.](./media/create-resource-iot-hub.png 'Create an IoT Hub')

2. On the IoT Hub blade Basics tab, enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

   - **Resource group**: Choose Use existing and select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.

   - **Region**: Select the location you are using for this hands-on lab.

   - **IoT Hub Name**: Enter a unique name, such as smartmeter-hub-SUFFIX.

     ![The Basics blade for IoT Hub is displayed, with the values specified above entered into the appropriate fields.](./media/iot-hub-basics-blade.png 'Create IoT Hub Basic blade')

   - Select **Next: Size and Scale**.

   - On the Size and scale blade, accept the default Pricing and scale tier of S1: Standard tier, and select **Review + create**.

   - Select **Create** on the Review + create blade.

3. When the IoT Hub deployment is completed, you will receive a notification in the Azure portal. Select **Go to resource** in the notification.

   ![Screenshot of the Deployment succeeded message, with the Go to resource button highlighted.](./media/iot-hub-deployment-succeeded.png 'Deployment succeeded message')

4. From the IoT Hub's Overview blade, select **Shared access policies** under Settings on the left-hand menu.

   ![Screenshot of the Overview blade, settings section. Under Settings, Shared access policies is highlighted.](./media/iot-hub-shared-access-policies.png 'Overview blade, settings section')

5. Select **iothubowner** policy.

   ![The Azure portal is shown with the iothubowner selected.](./media/iot-hub-shared-access-policies-iothubowner.png 'IoT Hub Owner shared access policy')

6. In the **iothubowner** blade, select the Copy button to the right of the **Connection string - primary key** field. You will be pasting the connection string value into a TextBox's Text property value in the next task.

   ![Screenshot of the iothubowner blade. The connection string - primary key field is highlighted.](./media/iot-hub-shared-access-policies-iothubowner-blade.png 'iothubowner blade')

### Task 2: Configure the Smart Meter Simulator

If you want to save this connection string with your project (in case you stop debugging or otherwise close the simulator), you can set this as the default text for the text box. Follow these steps to configure the connection string:

1. Return to the `SmartMeterSimulator` solution in Visual Studio on your Lab VM.

2. In the Solution Explorer, double-click `MainForm.cs` to open it. (If the Solution Explorer is not in the upper left corner of your Visual Studio instance, you can find it under the View menu in Visual Studio.)

   ![In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, SmartMeterSimulator is expanded, and under it, MainForm.cs is highlighted.](media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-mainform-cs.png 'Visual Studio Solution Explorer')

3. In the Windows Forms designer surface, click the **IoT Hub Connection String TextBox** to select it.

   ![The Windows Form designer surface is opened to the MainForm.cs tab. The IoT Hub Connection String is highlighted, but is empty.](./media/smart-meter-simulator-iot-hub-connection-string.png 'Windows Form designer surface')

4. In the Properties panel, scroll until you see the **Text** property. Paste your IoT Hub connection string value copied in step 6 of the previous task into the value for the Text property. (If the properties window is not visible below the Solution Explorer, right-click the TextBox, and select **Properties**.)

   ![In the Properties panel, the Text property is highlighted, and is set to HostName=smartmeter-hub.](./media/smart-meter-simulator-iot-hub-connection-string-text-property.png 'Solution Explorer')

5. Your connection string should now be present every time you run the Smart Meter Simulator.

   ![The Windows Form designer surface is opened to the MainForm.cs tab. The IoT Hub Connection String now displays.](./media/smart-meter-simulator-iot-hub-connection-string-populated.png 'IoT Hub Connection String dialog')

6. Save `MainForm.cs`.

## Exercise 2: Completing the Smart Meter Simulator

Duration: 60 minutes

Fabrikam has left you a partially completed sample in the form of the Smart Meter Simulator solution. You will need to complete the missing lines of code that deal with device registration management and device telemetry transmission that communicate with your IoT Hub.

### Task 1: Implement device management with the IoT Hub

1. In Visual Studio on your Lab VM, use Solution Explorer to open the file `DeviceManager.cs`.

2. From the Visual Studio **View** menu, click **Task List**.

   ![On the Visual Studio View menu, Task List is selected.](media/visual-studio-view-menu-task-list.png 'Visual Studio View menu')

3. In the Task List, you will see a list of `TODO` tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed. Complete the line of code below each `TODO` using the code below as a reference.

4. The following code represents the completed tasks in `DeviceManager.cs`:

   ```csharp
   class DeviceManager
   {
       static string connectionString;
       static RegistryManager registryManager;

       public static string HostName { get; set; }

       public static void IotHubConnect(string cnString)
       {
           connectionString = cnString;

           //TODO: 1.Create an instance of RegistryManager from connectionString
           registryManager = RegistryManager.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);

           var builder = IotHubConnectionStringBuilder.Create(cnString);

           HostName = builder.HostName;
       }

               }
               else

                   MessageBox.Show($"An error occurred while registering one or more devices:\r\n{ex.Message}");
               }
           }

   ```

5. Save `DeviceManager.cs`.

### Task 2: Implement the communication of telemetry with IoT Hub

1. Open `Sensor.cs` from the Solution Explorer, and complete the `TODO` items indicated within the code that are responsible for transmitting telemetry data to the IoT Hub.

2. The following code shows the completed result:

   ```csharp
   class Sensor
   {
       private DeviceClient _DeviceClient;
       private string _IotHubUri { get; set; }

   ![The iot-cluster is attached and its menu is expanded, with Start Cluster highlighted](media/azure-databricks-notebook-start-cluster.png 'Start cluster')

6. In the first cell of your Databricks notebook (referred to as a paragraph in notebook jargon), enter the following **Python code** that create widgets in the notebook for entering your Azure storage account name and key.

   ```python
   # Create widgets for storage account name and key
   dbutils.widgets.text("accountName", "", "Account Name")
   dbutils.widgets.text("accountKey", "", "Account Key")
   ```

7. Now, select the Run button on the right side of the cell, and select **Run cell**.

   ![A cell in a Databricks Notebook is displayed, and the Run menu is visible with Run Cell highlighted in the menu.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-run-cell.png 'Datebricks Notebook run cell')

8. When the cell finishes executing, you will see the Account Key and Account Name widgets appear at the top of the notebook, just below the toolbar.

   ![In the Databricks notebook, Account Key and Account Name widgets are highlighted.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-widgets.png 'Databricks Notebooks widgets')

9. You will also notice a message at the bottom of the cell indicating that the cell execution completed, and the amount of time it took.

   ![A message is displayed at the bottom of the cell indicating how long the command took to execute.](media/azure-databricks-cell-execution-time.png 'Cell execution time')

10. Enter your Azure Storage account key into the Account Key widget text box, and your Azure storage account name into the Account Name widget text box. These values can be obtained from the Access keys blade in your storage account.

    ![The Account Key and Account Name widgets are populated with values from the Azure storage account.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-widgets-populated.png 'Databricks Notebooks widgets')

11. At the bottom of the first cell, select the + button to insert a new cell below it.

    ![The Insert new cell button is highlighted at the bottom of the Databricks cell.](media/azure-databricks-insert-new-cell.png 'Insert new cell')

12. In the new cell, paste the following code that will assign the values you entered into the widgets you created above into variables that will be used throughout the notebook.

    ```python
    # Get values entered into widgets
    accountName = dbutils.widgets.get("accountName")
    accountKey = dbutils.widgets.get("accountKey")
    ```

13. Run the cell.

14. Insert a new cell into the notebook, and paste the following code to mount your blob storage account into Databricks File System (DBFS), then run the cell.

    ```python
    # Mount the blob storage account at /mnt/smartmeters. This assumes your container name is smartmeters, and you have a folder named smartmeters within that container, as specified in the exercises above.
    dbutils.fs.mount(
      source = "wasbs://smartmeters@" + accountName + ".blob.core.windows.net/smartmeters",
      mount_point = "/mnt/smartmeters",
      extra_configs = {"fs.azure.account.key." + accountName + ".blob.core.windows.net": accountKey})
    ```

    >**Note**: Mounting Azure Blob storage directly to DBFS allows you to access files as if they were on the local file system.

15. Once your blob storage account is mounted, you can access them with Databricks Utilities, `dbutils.fs` commands. Insert a new cell, and paste the code below to see how `dbutils.fs.ls` can be used to list the files and folders directly below the smartmeters folder.

    ```python
    # Inspect the file structure
    dbutils.fs.ls("/mnt/smartmeters/")
    ```

16. Run the cell.

17. You know from inspecting the files in the storage container that the files are contained within a folder structure resembling, `smartmeters/YYYY-MM-DD/HH`. You can use wildcards to obfuscate the date and hour folders, as well as the file names, and access all the files in all the folders. Insert another cell into the notebook, paste the following code, and run the cell to load the data from the files in blob storage into a Databricks Dataframe.

    ```python
    # Create a Dataframe containing data from all the files in blob storage, regardless of the folder they are located within.
    df = spark.read.options(header='true', inferSchema='true').csv("dbfs:/mnt/smartmeters/*/*/*.csv",header=True)
    print(df.dtypes)
    ```

18. The cell above also outputs the value of the `df.dtypes` property, which is a list of the data types of the columns added to the Dataframe, similar to the following:

    ![Output from the df.dtypes property is displayed.](media/azure-databricks-df-dtypes-output.png 'Output from Dataframe dtypes')

19. Insert another cell, and run the following code to view the first 10 records contained in the Dataframe.

    ```python
    df.show(10)
    ```

20. Now, you can save the Dataframe to a global table in Databricks. This will make the table accessible to all users and clusters in your Databricks workspace. Insert a new cell, and run the following code.

    ```python
    df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("SmartMeters")
    ```

21. Now, you will use the `%sql` magic command to change the language of the next cell to SQL from the notebook's default language, Python, then execute a SQL command to aggregate the SmartMeter data by average temperature. Paste the following code into a new cell, and run the cell.

    ```sql
    %sql
    SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS count, AVG(temp) AS averageTemp FROM SmartMeters GROUP BY id ORDER BY id
    ```

22. The output from the SQL command should resemble the following table:

    ![Output from executing a SQL statement a Databricks notebook cell using the %sql magic command.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-sql-magic-command.png 'SQL magic command')

23. Now, execute the same command in a new cell, this time using Spark SQL so you can save the summary data into a Dataframe. Copy and execute the following code into a new cell.

    ```python
    # Query the table to create a Dataframe containing the summary
    summary = spark.sql("SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS count, AVG(temp) AS averageTemp FROM SmartMeters GROUP BY id ORDER BY id")

    # Save the new pre-computed table
    summary.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("DeviceSummary")
    ```

24. Next, query from this summary table by executing the following query in a new cell.

    ```sql
    %sql
    SELECT * FROM DeviceSummary
    ```

25. Below the results table, button provide access to change the visualization for tabular output. Select the **chart** button, and then select **Plot Options**.

    ![Buttons for displaying tablular results in different formats in Databricks](media/azure-databricks-notebook-visualizations.png 'Visualization options')

26. In the Customize Plot dialog, set the following:

    - **Keys**: Add id.
    - **Values**: Add averageTemp.
    - **Aggregation**: Select AVG.
    - Select **Grouped** as the chart type.
    - **Display type**: Select Bar chart.

      ![Plot customization options dialog in Azure databricks, with id in the Keys field, averageTemp in the Values field, Aggregation set to AVG, and the chart set to a grouped bar chart.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-customize-plot.png)

27. Select **Apply**.

28. Observe the results graphed as a column chart, where each column represents a device's average temperature.

## Exercise 5: Reporting device outages with IoT Hub Operations Monitoring

Duration: 20 minutes

Fabrikam would like to be alerted when devices disconnect and fail to reconnect after a period. Since they are already using PowerBI to visualize hot data, they would like to see a list of any of these devices in a report.

### Task 1: Enable verbose connection monitoring on the IoT Hub

To keep track of device connects and disconnects, we first need to enable verbose connection monitoring.

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the IoT Hub you provisioned earlier, **smartmeter-hub-SUFFIX**.

2. Under Settings in the left-hand menu, select **Operations monitoring**.

   ![Under Settings, Operations monitoring is selected.](media/iot-hub-settings-operations-monitoring.png 'Operations monitoring')

3. Select **Verbose** for **Log events when a device connects or disconnects from the IoT Hub**.

   ![In the Monitoring categories section, Verbose is selected under Log events when a device connects or disconnects from the IoT Hub.](./media/iot-hub-operation-monitoring-device-connections-verbose-logging.png 'Monitoring categories section')

4. Select **Save**.

### Task 2: Collect device connection telemetry with the hot path Stream Analytics job

Now that the device connections are being logged, update your hot path Stream Analytics job (the first one you created) with a new input that ingests device telemetry from Operations Monitoring. Next, create a query that joins all connected and disconnected events with a `DATEDIFF` function that only returns devices with a disconnect event, but no reconnect event within 120 seconds. Output the events to Power BI.

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the **hot-stream** Stream Analytics job (the first one you created).

2. Stop the job if it is currently running, from the Overview blade, by selecting **Stop**, then **Yes** when prompted.

   ![The Stop button is highlighted on the Stream Analytics job Overview blade.](media/stream-analytics-job-stop.png 'Stop Stream Analytics Job')

3. On the Stream Analytics job blade, select **Inputs** from the left-hand menu, under Job Topology, then select **+Add stream input**, and select **IoT Hub** from the dropdown menu to add an input connected to your IoT Hub.

   ![On the Stream Analytics job blade, Inputs is selected under Job Topology in the left-hand menu, and +Add stream input is highlighted in the Inputs blade, and IoT Hub is highlighted in the drop down menu.](media/stream-analytics-job-inputs-add.png 'Add Stream Analytics job inputs')

4. On the New Input blade, enter the following:

   - **Input alias**: Enter connections.
   - Choose **Select IoT Hub from your subscriptions**.
   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **IoT Hub**: Select the smartmeter-hub-SUFFIX IoT Hub.
   - **Endpoint**: Select Operations monitoring.
   - **Shared access policy name**: Select service.
   - **Consumer Group**: Leave set to $Default.
   - **Event serialization format**: Select JSON.
   - **Encoding**: Select UTF-8.
   - **Event compression type**: Leave set to None.

     ![IoT Hub New Input blade is displayed with the values specified above entered into the appropriate fields.](media/stream-analytics-job-inputs-add-iot-hub-input-operations-management.png 'IoT Hub New Input blade')

5. Select **Save**.

6. Next, select **Outputs** from the left-hand menu, under Job Topology, and select **+ Add**, then select **Power BI** from the drop down menu.

   ![Outputs is highlighted in the left-hand menu, under Job Topology, +Add is selected, and Power BI is highlighted in the drop down menu.](media/stream-analytics-job-outputs-add-power-bi.png 'Add Power BI Output')

7. On the Power BI output blade, enter the following:

   - **Output alias**: Set to powerbi-outage.
   - Select **Authorize** to authorize the connection to your Power BI account. When prompted in the popup window, enter the account credentials you used to create your Power BI account in Before the Hands-on Lab, Task 1.
   - **Group Workspace**: Select the default, My Workspace.
   - **Dataset Name**: Enter deviceoutage.
   - **Table Name**: Enter deviceoutage.

     ![Power BI blade. Output alias is powerbi-outage, dataset name is deviceoutage, table name is deviceoutage.](media/stream-analytics-job-outputs-add-power-bi-operations-management.png 'Add Power BI Output')

8. Select **Save**.

9. Next, select **Query** from the left-hand menu, under Job Topology.

   ![Under Job Topology, Query is selected.](./media/stream-analytics-job-query.png 'Stream Analytics Query')

10. Replace the hot path query, which selects the averages of the temperatures into the PowerBI output, with queries that perform the following:

    - Select **device disconnection events**.
    - Select **device connection events**.
    - Join these two streams together using the Stream Analytics `DATEDIFF` operation on the `LEFT JOIN`, and then filter out any records where there was a match. This gives us devices that had a disconnect event, but no corresponding connect event within 120 seconds. Output to the Service Bus.
    - Execute the original hot path query.

11. Replace the existing query with the following, and select **Save** in the **command bar** at the top. (Be sure to substitute in your output aliases and input aliases):

    ```sql
    WITH
    Disconnected AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM connections TIMESTAMP BY [Time]
    WHERE OperationName = 'deviceDisconnect'
        AND Category = 'Connections'
    ),
    Connected AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM connections TIMESTAMP BY [Time]
    WHERE OperationName = 'deviceConnect'
        AND Category = 'Connections'
    )

    SELECT Disconnected.DeviceId, Disconnected.Time
    INTO [powerbi-outage]
    FROM Disconnected
    LEFT JOIN Connected
        ON DATEDIFF(second, Disconnected, Connected) BETWEEN 0 AND 120
        AND Connected.deviceId = Disconnected.deviceId
    WHERE Connected.DeviceId IS NULL;

    SELECT AVG(temp) AS Average, id
    INTO powerbi
    FROM temps
    GROUP BY TumblingWindow(minute, 5), id;
    ```

12. Select **Save**, and **Yes** when prompted with the confirmation.

    ![Save button on the Query blade is highlighted](./media/stream-analytics-job-query-save.png 'Query Save button')

13. Return to the Overview blade on your Stream Analytics job and select **Start**.

    ![The Start button is highlighted on the Overview blade.](./media/stream-analytics-job-start.png 'Overview blade start button')

14. In the Start job blade, select **Now** (the job will start processing messages from the current point in time onward).

    ![Now is selected on the Start job blade.](./media/stream-analytics-job-start-job.png 'Start job blade')

15. Select **Start**.

16. Allow your Stream Analytics Job a few minutes to start.

### Task 3: Test the device outage notifications

Register and activate a few devices on the Smart Meter Simulator, then connect them. Deactivate them without reconnecting in order for them to show up in the device outage report we will create in the next task.

1. Run the Smart Meter Simulator from Visual Studio.

2. Select **Register**.

   ![Register button](./media/smart-meter-simulator-register.png 'Register button')

### Task 4: Visualize disconnected devices with Power BI

1. Log on to **Power BI** to see if data is being collected.

2. As done previously, select My Workspace on the left-hand menu, then select the Datasets tab. A new dataset should appear, named **deviceoutage**. (It is starred to indicate it is new) If you do not see the dataset, you may need to connect your devices on the Smart Meter Simulator, then disconnect and unregister them and wait up to 5 minutes.

   ![On the Power BI window, My Workspace is highlighted in the left pane, and the Datasets tab is highlighted in the right pane. Under Name, deviceoutage is highlighted.](./media/power-bi-datasets-deviceoutage.png 'Power BI window')

3. Select the **Create report** icon under actions for the dataset.

   ![Next to deviceoutage, the Create report icon is highlighted.](./media/power-bi-datasets-deviceoutage-create-report.png 'Create report icon')

4. Add a **Table visualization**.

   ![The table icon is highlighted on the Visualizations palette.](./media/power-bi-visualizations-table.png 'Visualizations palette')

5. Select the **deviceid** and **time** fields, which will automatically be added to the table.

   ![In the Fields listing, under deviceoutage, deviceid and time are both selected.](./media/power-bi-visualizations-table-fields.png 'Fields listing')

6. You should see the Device Id of each of the devices you connected, and then disconnected for more than 2 minutes.
