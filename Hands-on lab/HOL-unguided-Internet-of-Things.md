# Internet of Things hands-on lab unguided

Updated June 2018

In this hands-on lab, you will implement an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path. After completing the hands-on lab, you will have a better understanding of implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.

If you have not yet completed the steps to set up your environment in [Before the hands-on lab](./Setup.md), you will need to do that before proceeding.

## Abstract

In this hands-on lab, you will construct an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build an IoT solution implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.

## Overview

Fabrikam provides services and smart meters for enterprise energy (electrical power) management. Their "*You-Left-The-Light-On*" service enables the enterprise to understand their energy consumption.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![Diagram of the preferred solution. From a high-level, the commerce solution uses an API App to host the Payments web service with which the Vending Machine interacts to conduct purchase transactions. The Payment Web API invokes a 3rd party payment gateway as needed for authorizing and capturing credit card payments, and logs the purchase transaction to SQL DB. The data for these purchase transactions is stored using an In-Memory table with a Columnar Index, which will support the write-heavy workload while still allowing analytics to operate, such as queries coming from Power BI Desktop.](./media/preferred-solution-architecture.png "Preferred high-level architecture")

Messages are ingested from the Smart Meters via IoT Hub and temporarily stored there. A Stream Analytics job pulls telemetry messages from IoT Hub and sends the messages to two different destinations. There are two Stream Analytics jobs, one that retrieves all messages and sends them to Blob Storage (the cold path), and another that selects out only the important events needed for reporting in real time (the hot path). Data entering the hot path will be reported on using Power BI visualizations and reports. For the cold path, Azure Databricks can be used to apply the batch computation needed for the reports at scale.

Other alternatives for processing of the ingested telemetry would be to use an HDInsight Storm cluster, a WebJob running the EventProcessorHost in place of Stream Analytics, or HDInsight running with Spark streaming. Depending on the type of message filtering being conducted for hot and cold stream separation, IoT Hub Message Routing might also be used, but this has the limitation that messages follow a single path, so with the current implementation, it would not be possible to send all messages to the cold path, while simultaneously sending some of the same messages into the hot path. An important limitation to keep in mind for Stream Analytics is that it is very restrictive on the format of the input data it can process: the payload must be UTF8 encoded JSON, UTF8 encoded CSV (fields delimited by commas, spaces, tabs, or vertical pipes), or AVRO, and it must be well formed. If any devices transmitting telemetry cannot generate output in these formats (e.g., because they are legacy devices), or their output can be not well formed at times, then alternatives that can better deal with these situations should be investigated. Additionally, any custom code or logic cannot be embedded with Stream Analytics---if greater extensibility is required, the alternatives should be considered.

> NOTE: The preferred solution is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN
  - Trial subscriptions will not work
- A virtual machine configured with:
  - Visual Studio Community 2017 15.6 or later
  - Azure SDK 2.9 or later (Included with Visual Studio 2017)

## Exercise 1: IoT Hub provisioning

Duration: 15 minutes

In your architecture design session with Fabrikam, it was agreed that you would use an Azure IoT Hub to manage both the device registration and telemetry ingest from the Smart Meter Simulator. Your team also identified the Microsoft provided Device Explorer project that Fabrikam can use to view the list and status of devices in the IoT Hub registry.

### Task 1: Provision IoT Hub

In these steps, you will provision an instance of IoT Hub.

#### Tasks to complete

- Provision an IoT Hub instance.
- Determine and take note of the connection strings required for 1) full control and 2) read/write access to the device registry.

#### Exit criteria

- You have an IoT Hub provisioned in your Azure subscription.
- You have properly selected the connection strings having appropriate permissions.

### Task 2: Configure the Smart Meter Simulator

If you want to save this connection string with your project (in case you stop debugging or otherwise close the simulator), you can set this as the default text for the text box. Follow these steps to configure the connection string:

#### Tasks to complete

- Edit the Fabrikam Smart Meter Simulator so that the IoT connection string text box has a value of your connection string to the IoT Hub having full permissions.

#### Exit criteria

- Your connection string should now be present every time you run the Smart Meter Simulator (in subsequent steps).

## Exercise 2: Completing the Smart Meter Simulator

Duration: 60 minutes

Fabrikam has left you a partially completed sample in the form of the Smart Meter Simulator solution. You will need to complete the missing lines of code that deal with device registration management and device telemetry transmission that communicate with your IoT Hub.

### Task 1: Implement device management with the IoT Hub

#### Tasks to complete

- In the solution, open `DeviceManager.cs`, and complete the lines of code below each of the `TODO` comments.

#### Exit criteria

- There are sixteen `TODOs` in this file, and you should have completed all of them. You can use the Task List to see all the tasks at a glance. From the **View** menu, click **Task List**. There you will see a list of `TODO` tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed.

### Task 2: Implement the communication of telemetry with the IoT Hub

#### Tasks to complete

- In the solution, open Sensor.cs`, and complete the lines of code below each of the `TODO` comments.

#### Exit criteria

- There are four `TODOs` in this file, and you should have completed all of them. You can use the Task List to see all the tasks at a glance. From the **View** menu, click **Task List**. There you will see a list of `TODO` tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed.

### Task 3: Verify device registration and telemetry

#### Tasks to complete

- Build and run the Smart Meter Simulator.
- Register all devices.
- By clicking on 1--10 of the windows within the building in the app, select the devices to install (they should turn yellow) and then activate them (after which they turn green).
- Use Device Explorer in the IoT blade to view the list of registered devices. How many of them have been activated in the list? How can you tell?
- Connect the activated devices and observe that they are sending telemetry.

#### Exit criteria

- You should have the Smart Meter Simulator running and actively transmitting telemetry.

## Exercise 3: Hot path data processing with Stream Analytics

Duration: 45 minutes

Fabrikam would like to visualize the "hot" data showing the average temperature reported by each device over a 5-minute window in Power BI.

### Task 1: Create a Stream Analytics job for hot path processing to Power BI

#### Tasks to complete

- Create an Azure Stream Analytics job that reads the JSON/UTF8 serialized telemetry from your IoT Hub and writes to Power BI.
- Query the input data over a 5-minute tumbling window.

#### Exit criteria

- Verify that your Stream Analytics job is receiving and processing telemetry from your Smart Meter Simulator instance.

### Task 2: Visualize hot data with Power BI

#### Tasks to complete

- Using Power BI create a report that contains a Column Chart visualization that on the x-axis has the device IDs and on the y-axis has the maximum value of the average temperature reported.
- Add another Column Chart visualization that plots the minimum value of the average temperature by device.
- Add a Table visualization that lists a table with a device ID and an average of the temperature columns.

#### Exit criteria

- You can view the report in Reading View and click one device data point to highlight it across all three of the visualizations.

## Exercise 4: Cold path data processing with HDInsight Spark

Duration: 60 minutes

Fabrikam would like to be able to capture all the "cold" data into scalable storage so that they can summarize it periodically using a Spark SQL query.

### Task 1: Create a Storage account

#### Task to complete

- Create a storage account for storing blobs exported from your cold path Stream Analytics job.

#### Exit criteria

- You have a blob storage account in Azure

### Task 2: Create the Stream Analytics job for cold path processing

To capture all metrics for the cold path, set up another Stream Analytics job that will write all events to Blob storage for analyses by Spark running on HDInsight.

#### Tasks to complete

- Create an Azure Stream Analytics job that reads from your IoT Hub the JSON/UTF8 serialized telemetry and writes to Azure Storage blobs as CSV files.
- Query the input data so that all data points are written raw to storage without any filtering or summarization.

#### Exit criteria

- Verify that your Stream Analytics job is receiving and processing telemetry from your Smart Meter Simulator instance.

### Task 3: Verify CSV files in Blob storage

#### Tasks to complete

- Locate the CSV file created in Blob storage.

#### Exit criteria

- You have taken note of the container relative path to the CSV file as it appears in Blob storage.

### Task 4: Process with Spark SQL

In this task, you will create a new Databricks notebook to perform some processing and visualization of the cold path data using Spark.

#### Tasks to complete

- Process the data by using a Databricks notebook to summarize the data by device ID, count of events per device, and the average temperature per device.

#### Exit criteria

- You can visualize the results of the query in the Databricks notebook using a column chart that displays the ID as the x-axis and the average of the averageTemp as the y-axis.

## Exercise 5: Reporting device outages with IoT Hub Operations Monitoring

Duration: 20 minutes

Fabrikam would like to be alerted when devices disconnect and fail to reconnect after a period. Since they are already using PowerBI to visualize hot data, they would like to see a list of any of these devices in a report.

### Task 1: Enable verbose connection monitoring on the IoT Hub

To keep track of device connects and disconnects, we first need to enable verbose connection monitoring.

#### Tasks to complete

- Enable verbose connection monitoring.

#### Exit criteria

- You have enabled connection monitoring via IoT Hub Operations Monitoring, collecting all device connect and disconnect events.

### Task 2: Collect device connection telemetry with the hot path Stream Analytics job

Now that the device connections are being logged, update your hot path Stream Analytics job (the first one you created) with a new input that ingests device telemetry from Operations Monitoring. Next, create a query that joins all connected and disconnected events with a `DATEDIFF` function that only returns devices with a disconnect event, but no reconnect event within 120 seconds. Output the events to Power BI.

#### Tasks to complete

- Update your hot path Stream Analytics job (the first one you created) with a new input that ingests device telemetry from Operations Monitoring.
- Create a query that joins all connected and disconnected events with a `DATEDIFF` function that only returns devices with a disconnect event, but no reconnect event within 120 seconds.
- Output the events to Power BI.

#### Exit criteria

- Verify that your Stream Analytics job is still receiving and processing telemetry from your Smart Meter Simulator instance, and that new events are being captured after the devices have been disconnected for at least 2 minutes.

### Task 3: Test the device outage notifications

Register and activate a few devices on the Smart Meter Simulator, then connect them. Deactivate them without reconnecting in order for them to show up in the device outage report we will create in the next task.

#### Tasks to complete

- Register and activate a few devices on the Smart Meter Simulator, then connect them.
- Deactivate the devices without reconnecting, allowing them to show up in the device outage report we will create in the next task.

#### Exit criteria

- Devices have been connected, and unregistered for more than 120 seconds, so they will appear on the outage report.

### Task 4: Visualize disconnected devices with Power BI

#### Tasks to complete

- Create a Table visualization in Power BI, referencing the new device outage dataset created by the Stream Analytics output that was configured in Task 2.

#### Exit criteria

- Devices that connected, then were disconnected for longer than 120 seconds via the Smart Meter Simulator should be listed in the Table visualization in Power BI. Use the column headings to sort the devices by Device Id or Timestamp.
