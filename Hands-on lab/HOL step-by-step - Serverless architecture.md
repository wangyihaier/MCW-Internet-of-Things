# Serverles architecture hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hand-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, IoT Hub, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

At the end of the hands-on-lab, you will have confidence in designing, developing, and monitoring a serverless solution that is resilient, scalable, and cost-effective.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The Solution diagram is described in the text following this diagram.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Serverlessarchitectureimages/media/image2_New.png 'Solution diagram')



## Exercise 1: Create functions in the portal


Create two new Azure Functions written in Node.js, using the Azure portal. These will be triggered by Event Grid and output to Azure Cosmos DB to save the results of license plate processing done by the ProcessImage function.

7)  Replace the code in the new SaveSensorInfo function with the following:

**Java Script**
```

   module.exports = function (context, IoTHubMessages) {
    context.log(`JavaScript eventhub trigger function called for message array: ${IoTHubMessages}`);

    var count = 0;
    var totalTemperature = 0.0;
    var temperature = 0.0;
    var deviceId = "";

    IoTHubMessages.forEach(message => {
        context.log(`Processed message: ${message}`);
        count++;
        temperature = message.temp;
        deviceId = message.id;
    });

    var output = {
        "deviceId": deviceId,
        "temperature": temperature
    };

    context.log(`Output content: ${output}`);

    context.bindings.outputDocument = output;

    context.done();
};

```

**C#**
```
#r "Newtonsoft.Json"

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;

public static IActionResult Run(string myIoTHubMessage, out object outputDocument, ILogger log)
{
    log.LogInformation($"C# IoT Hub trigger function processed a message: {myIoTHubMessage}");
	
    string deviceId="";
	float temp =0F;
    
    var raw_obj=JObject.Parse(myIoTHubMessage);
    deviceId=(string)raw_obj["id"];
    temp=(float)raw_obj["temp"];
   
	outputDocument = new
	{
		deviceId,
		temp
	};

    log.LogInformation($"output doc: {outputDocument}");

	return (ActionResult)new OkResult();
}
```


8.  Select **Save**.

### Task 2: Add an Azure Cosmos DB output to the SaveSensorInfo function

In this task, you will add an Azure Cosmos DB output binding to the SaveSensorInfo function, enabling it to save its data to the Processed collection.

1.  Expand the **SaveSensorInfo** function in the menu, the select **Integrate**.

2.  Under Outputs, select **+ New Output**, select **Azure Cosmos DB** from the list of outputs, then select **Select**.
